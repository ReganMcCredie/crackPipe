## Key Features
  
* Searches for active local networks, allowing you to select a target network.
* Captures a WPA/WPA2 password hash, before running it against a list of known passwords.
* Intuitive and minimal UI, using the Adafruit 128x64 OLED Bonnet for Raspberry Pi.
* Offloads processing to a remote server, allowing hashes to be cracked much faster.
